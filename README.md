# BirbDex - a game for Ludum Dare 58

__Theme: Collector__

Time to chill! Sit down and relax with your camera on a beautiful terrace: the sky is full of birds and you're a master at whistling. Just a few notes and they'll come for you to take a picture... it's just a matter of knowing what to sing!

## How to play

Follow the birds with the cursor to hear their call.

Try to recreate them by emitting sound sequences with **WASD**.

Then take a picture with **P**.

Collect all birds to unlock a secret!
